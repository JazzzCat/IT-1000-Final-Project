# **What are some goals for the SpaceX program?**

Elon Musk has stated that he wishes space travel to be accessible for almost anyone who wants to.
Musk made it known that one is his main goals is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.
Also in 2016, Musk announced his plans to build large spaceships to reach Mars. He plans to send at least 2 unmanned cargo ships to Mars in 2022. The plan for them is to scout out any sources of water. If water was found, then his next plan of action is going to try and send manned ships to Mars as early as 2024.

The main goals for SpaceX is to increase the accessibility for space travel, but also to eventually colonize Mars. Musk even believes that there is a 70% chance that he will be able to get to mars within his own lifetime, and then would permanently resettle on the *"Red Planet"*
