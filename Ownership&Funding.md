# Ownership and Funding

In August 2008, SpaceX accepted a gracious $20 million investment from Founders Fund. Founders Fund is a firm based in San Francisco and they invest across many stages such as aerospace, artificial intelligence, advanced computing, etc. The founder, Elon Musk, has around 70 million shares in his company and they are estimated to be worth around $875 million on private markets. Because of this, SpaceX was roughly valued at $1.3 billion as of February 2012. By May 2012, SpaceX operated on a total funding of approximately $1 billion over its first decade of operation. 

By March 2018, SpaceX had contracts for over 100 launch missions, and each one of the contracts provides down payments at the contracts signing with most of them paying progress payments as the vehicle components are built in advanced of mission launch. SpaceX raised a total of $1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds in 2019. In April 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was raising $500 million in funding.
