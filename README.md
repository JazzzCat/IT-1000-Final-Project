SpaceX stands for Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has been becoming more well-known every year. NASA has shown big interest into this company and has awarded SpaceX with several contracts over the past two decades, which range from development of new spacecrafts to transporting cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). NASA has also awarded SpaceX with more than $3.1 billion to fund the development of its new Crew Dragon capsule. The Dragon capsule is a class of reusable cargo spacecraft. A big thing that the company is known for, is that they are able to reuse the rockets / capsules multiple times instead of having to rebuild them each time they launch.
